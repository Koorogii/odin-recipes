        These are the ingredients you'll need to make this bakery-worthy red velvet brownie recipe:

        <ul><li><b>Sugar</b>: These red velvet cheesecake brownies start with a cup of white sugar. You'll need more white sugar for the cream cheese filling.</li>

        <li><b>Cocoa powder</b>: Unsweetened cocoa powder gives the brownies their chocolatey flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Food coloring</b>: You can omit the red food coloring if you like, but your brownies won't have the signature red velvet hue.</li>
        <li><b>Vanilla</b>: Vanilla extract enhances the flavors of both the brownies and the filling.</li>
        <li><b>Vinegar</b>: White vinegar adds a hint of acidity.</li>

        <li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour gives the brownies structure.</li>
        <li><b>Cream cheese</b>: A cream cheese filling takes these decadent red velvet brownies over the top.</li></ul></p>
