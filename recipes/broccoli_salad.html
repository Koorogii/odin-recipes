    <p><h2>Ingredients for Broccoli Salad</h2>
        There isn't a one-size-fits-all rule when it comes to broccoli salad. In fact, every home chef may make their broccoli salad a little differently.

        There are a few ingredients everyone can agree on in a broccoli salad, though: broccoli and a creamy, mayo- and vinegar-based dressing are usually the two. Any additional ingredients are up to the cook, so here are the ingredients used in this recipe.
            <ul><li><b>Broccoli</b>: Starts with two heads of fresh broccoli.</li>
            <li><b>Bacon</b>: While bacon may not be the first ingredient to go on a salad, it is the most delicious.</li>
            <li><b>Onions</b>: A red onion is the best onion to use for this salad.</li>
            <li><b>Raisins</b>: These small, dried grapes add a prefect touch of sweetness.</li>
            <li><b>Nuts</b>: Sliced almonds are a great option to use for this recipe.</li>
            <li><b>Mayonnaise</b>: Your dressing starts with mayo. If the news didn't get to you, there is one brand all chefs say is the best.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar</b>: White sugar also helps sweeten up the salad and make the flavor a little more dynamic.</li>
            <li><b>Vinegar</b>: White wine vinegar is the best option to use for this recipe, but if you need to maje</li></ul>

            Broccoli salads also contain ingredients like seeds (like sunflower seeds), other dried fruit (like dried cranberries), and cheese (usually Cheddar). You can pick and choose which ingredients you want to add.

            The creamy dressing for the salad is almost always made with mayonnaise, white sugar, and white wine vinegar.</p>
